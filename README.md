# Project-FrozenLake
In reinforcement learning, agents are rewarded by the environment when they accomplish a predefined goal. In ❄️Frozen Lake, the agent is only rewarded when it reaches the state G (see the source code). We cannot control this reward, it is set in the environment: it's 1 when the agent reaches G, and 0 otherwise.
